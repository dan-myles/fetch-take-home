This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies 👏:

```bash
npm install --force
```

> We are forcing because Next is on React 19 and a lot of things still don't work with it. Not sure why
> Next defaults to 19 now :/

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
